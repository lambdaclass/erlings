# Erlings: Small exercises to get you used to reading and writing Erlang code

source: http://www.erlang.org/

> Erlang is a programming language used to build massively scalable soft real-time systems with requirements on high availability. Some of its uses are in telecoms, banking, e-commerce, computer telephony and instant messaging. Erlang's runtime system has built-in support for concurrency, distribution and fault tolerance.

One of the most important parts of any learning process it the resolution of practical problems by one self, but is hard when you don't have anything to guide you or something to compare with.

## Must Read
- Read [Learn you some Erlang for great good](http://learnyousomeerlang.com/)
