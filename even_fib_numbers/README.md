# Even Fibonacci Numbers

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

` 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...`

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.


Run tests with ``make``.

As a hint, the file you should be editing is `src/even_fib_numbers.erl`. But in any
case if the things get difficult you can check our [proposed solution](solution/even_fib_numbers.erl).
